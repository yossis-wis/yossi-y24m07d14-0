# Project 11 - Final Project 

## Goals
1. integrate the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the course to develop a final project that encompasses all the concepts learned.
2. Learn about the accelerometer sensor and how to use it in a project.
3. Learn about the OLED display and Buzzer effector and how to use them in a project.

## Setup
1. Use the setup from Project10-Fan_Speed and add the following components:
    - Accelerometer sensor
    - OLED display
    - Buzzer effector
    - connect the servo motor to the board

## Requirements
Build a system that: 
1. changes the angle of the servo motor based on the accelerometer sensor readings.
2. displays the angle in the OLED display and buzzer state.
3. if the angle exceeds a certain threshold, the buzzer should sound.
4. log the angle and the buzzer state in a csv file.
5. develop a GUI that displays the angle, the buzzer state, and the in real-time and logs the data in a csv file.

## Results
1. paste here the screenshot of the GUI that shows the angle of the servo motor, the buzzer state, and the accelerometer sensor readings in real-time.
2. paste an picture of the OLED display that shows the angle of the servo motor.
3. add the csv file to the project
4. add a video of the system in action?
