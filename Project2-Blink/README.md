# Project 2: Your first Program - BLINK

1. Open an example file
2. Understand the code structure and the loop function
3. Upload the code to the Arduino board
4. Observe the LED blinking

## Open an example file
 - Open the Arduino IDE
    - Go to File > Examples > 01.Basics > Blink
    
## Upload the code to the Arduino board
 - Connect the Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable
 - Select the correct board and port
    - Go to Tools > Board and select the appropriate board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
    - Go to Tools > Port and select the port to which your Arduino board is connected
    - Click on the Upload button (right arrow) in the Arduino IDE
    - Observe the LED on the Arduino board blinking
    
## Git
 - no need to commit anything in this project

## Results
- LED blinks when: the code is running
